# Page Goal

----

The goal of the Common Topics and their Data Science Lifecycle Locations" page is to place many of the common syllabi topics in the data science lifecycle or pipeline to see which stages of the lifecycle or pipeline these classes generally focus on. To achieve this goal, I first introduce two different ways of interpreting data, which would inform the data science lifecycle or pipeline. I then provide justification for why I adopt Philosopher of Science Sabina Leonelli's relational view of data and the data science lifecycle. I next provide examples of data science practices that would live within each stage of Leonelli's lifecycle. These examples ultimately inform my placement of many of the common "Course Topics" from the collected syllabi.

# Data Science Lifecycle

----

There are several ways to depict the data science lifecycle or pipeline. Though it might not be explicit, the endorsement of one lifecycle or pipeline over another endorses specific views about data, data models, and their respective relationships to what we take to be knowledge about our world. Philosopher of Science Sabina Leonelli explicates the value-ladenness of how we conceive of the data science lifecycle or pipeline in @Leonelli. 'Data models' refer to the "arrangements of data that are evaluated, manipulated and modified with the explicit goal of representing a phenomenon, which is often (though not always) meant to capture specific aspects of the world," [@Leonelli]. For example, a simple linear regression that uses years of education to model the expected income is a data model, as is an algorithm that utilizes millions of hyperparameters to predict an incarcerated individual's risk of recidivism. Yet, Leonelli definition of 'data models' also expands beyond statistical models. For instance, Leonelli would also classify data visualizations that describe a relationship between variables as a data model.

Per Leonelli, there are two popular conceptions of the relationship between data and data models and what we interpret to be knowledge about our world (i.e., different conceptions of the data and data models' epistemic roles). The first conception is the **representational view of data and data models** and the second conception is the **relational view of data and data models**. 

In the following two subsections, I provide a explication of the representational and relational view of data and models and provide reasoning for why we ought to reject the representational account of data and models in favor the relational view. I recommend reading Leonelli's article for a more in-depth justification of why we should use the relational view of data and models over the representational view.

## Representational View of Data and Data Models

In the representational view of data and data models informational content of data is regarded as fixed and completely independent of the researchers' background assumptions and context. Thus, data models are important insofar as they extract truth from the data. **CONTINUE TO CLARIFY**. 

```{r dpi= 500, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width='70%', out.height='70%', fig.alt="Data Science Lifecycle under the Representational View of Data and Models described by Sabina Leonelli in 2019. The lifecycle is represented as a circle with 3 components that all interact with one another. The components include: (1) World, (2) Data, and (3) Knowledge. (1) World is documented via (2) Data and (2) Data represents (1) World. Additonally, (3) Knowledge is based on (2) Data and (2) Data is used to infer (3) Knowledge.", fig.cap = "Data Science Lifecycle under the Representational View of Data and Models described by Sabina Leonelli in 2019. Any processing of the data, data organizing, or data modelling would merely be a tool to elcucidate the connection between Data and Knowledge and the World."}

```

## Relational View of Data and Data Models

Meanwhile, on the relational view of data and data models, data is any object treated as evidence for at least one claim about the world that "is possible to circulate...among individuals/groups" [@Leonelli]. Consequently, the informational content of data depends on the researchers' background assumptions and context about what they classify as evidence. As such, data models, not data, are taken to represent our world's phenomenon [@Leonelli].


```{r dpi= 500, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%', out.height='50%', fig.alt="Data Science Lifecycle under the Relational View of Data and Models conceptualized by Sabina Leonelli in 2019. The lifecycle is represented as a circle with 5 stages. The stages of inquiry include: (1) 'Interactions with the World', which produce (2) 'Objects', which are processed as 'Data', which are ordered as (4) 'Models representing the World', which is then interpreted as (5) 'Knowledge'. What is interpreted as (5) 'Knowledge' further informs (1) 'Interactions with the World'.", fig.cap = "Data Science Lifecycle under the Relational View of Data and Models conceptualized by Sabina Leonelli in 2019."}

## The Relational View versus the Representational View In-Practice

Consider how soccer match data influences our valuation of the match’s players (i.e., the phenomenon we are interested in understanding). 

**From the representational view of data and data models:** the data inherently represents the actual soccer matches and players’ values. As such, questions about the data are solely focused on whether our data is good enough. For instance, we may wonder if the sensors on the pitch are calibrated correctly.

**Meanwhile, from the relational view of data and data models:** data is only evidence in virtue of how it is organized. In turn, we would question why specific data can be evidence of a player’s value. For instance, we may ask if using data about the percentage of passes completed or kilometers run is better evidence of a soccer player’s value given our data model [@Beaulieu-Leonelli,59]. 

Such an example shows data in itself is *representationally ambiguous*. For instance, it is unclear what the sensors should be calibrated for (in other words, what they should measure), which data model should be used, which variables should be used within the data model and, thus, which data should be transformed into evidence. To determine what data represents researchers must use their background assumptions or theories to gather evidence about soccer players' valuations.

# Lifecycle Locations of the Most Common Syllabi Topics

<br>

## Lifecycle 1

<ul> I considered paradigmatic ethical issues that relate to each most common topic to place them on the Data Science lifecycle:</ul>

```{r results='hide'}
most_common <- syllabi_topics %>%
  group_by(Syllabi_Topics) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  rename(Count = n) %>%
  filter(Count >= 3)

Importantly though, there are arguments to be made for why the most common topics should overlap with other stages of the lifecycle too."}

## Lifecycle 2

*Rings with less opacity denote areas where there seems to be substantial overlap between common topics and the data science stage though these considerations are not "paradigmatic" ethical issues.*

**EXTRA**

I explicate Leonelli's view rather than merely supplying the final data science lifecycle is to underscore how our values influence data science. Leonelli's explication of the representational versus relational view of data and data models showcase that our conception of data science is deeply connected with how we value data and models. Ultimately, the idea that values influence Data Science is important to framing several of the ethical issues raised by data science, and avoiding the objection that ....
